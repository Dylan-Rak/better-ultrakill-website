                New Blood Ineractive, founded in 2014, orginaly began development of virtual reality games.<br>
                However, these plans never materialized. At the time, New Blood was looking for a pixel artist<br>
                and Clinkscales needed a publisher for his Kickstarter-backed game Super Galaxy Squadron, <br>
                so they agreed that New Blood would publish the game and Clinkscales join the company in return.<br>
                this was the start of New Blood as a publisher and they would later go on to publish many more games.<br>
                notable titles include: Dusk, ULTRAKILL, Faith and Amid Evil
