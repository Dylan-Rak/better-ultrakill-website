                    The revolver is the first weapon you get in the game, it has three varients and an alterante.<br>
                    <br>
                    The blue varient is called the piercer, you can hold alt fire to charge a high damage hit scan.<br>
                    <br>
                    The green revolver is called the marksman, with alt fire you can toss a coin that, when shot with a<br>
                    hit scan will ricochet into the nearest enemy and increase its damage.<br>
                    <br>
                    The red revolver is called the sharpshooter, holding alt fire you'll spin the revolver around your<br>
                    finger and on release o alt fire a hit scan will be shot out and ricochet of walls. the amount of ricochets<br>
                    is dependent on how long you spin the revolver.<br>
                    <br>
                    the alterante revolver has been dubbed the slab revolver by the community due to how you obtain it<br>
                    in every level of the first layer of the game, limbo, you can find buttons that when all are pressed a door<br>
                    will open revealing the revolver. the slab revolver simply fires slower, but does more damage.<br>

                    The shotgun is the second weapon in the game, much like the recolver it has 3 varients and an alterante.<br>
                    <br>
                    The blue shotgun is called the core eject, holding alt fire will allow you to shoot out a grenade that explodes on impact.<br>
                    <br>
                    The green shotgun is the pump charge shotgun, alt fire will pump the shot gun increasing the number of pellets shot out,<br>
                    but pump it too much and it will instead explode when fired.<br>
                    <br>
                    The red shotgun is the sawed-on, it adds a chainsaw to the front of the gun.<br>
                    <br>
                    The alternate shotgun is the Jackhammer, the primary fire is changed to a melee attack that increases in damage the faster your moving<br>
                    <br>
                    The alterante blue shotgun is slightly changed where instead of shooting the grenade out it is ejected right in front of you.<br>

                    The nailgun is the third weapon aquired by our protagonist and it is a uhhh... its a gun. this rifle is not chambered for nuance.<br>
                    <br>
                    The blue nailgun is the attracter nailgun it shoots magnets which attract nails to it nuff said.<br>
                    <br>
                    The green nailgun is the overheat varient, firing the nailgun heats up the nailgun and when at full charge you can <br>
                    fire out a very large volley of nails.<br>
                    <br>
                    The red varient of the nailgun is the best weapon in the game, you right click something shoot some nails around and then everything dies.<br>
                    <br>
                    The alternate version of the nailgun is the sawblade launcher, it changes the nails you fire into saws.<br>
                    <br>
                    The saws orbit around the magnets and overheat sawblade launcher fires one large fire saw.
